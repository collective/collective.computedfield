Changelog
=========

0.1 (unreleased)
----------------

- plone.schemaeditor support; requires this package be an installable add-on,
  with a GenericSetup profile.  The reason this is necessary is to include
  a JavaScript shim to support z3c.form multi-select widget JS when edit
  form for a field in schemaeditor is within Plone 4 overlays.

- Initial development, package scaffolding, interfaces, basic components.
